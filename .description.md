<!-- Please provide a short overview of the features of this service.-->

### Scope and Features:

Metldata is a framework for handling the entire lifetime of metadata by addressing the
a complex combination of challenges that makes it suitable especially for public
archives for sensitive data:

#### Immutability
It is guaranteed that data entries do not change over time making reproducibility
possible without having to rely on local snapshots.

#### Accessibility
A stable accession is assigned to each resource. Together with the immutability
property, this guarantees that you will always get the same data when querying with the
same accession.

#### Corrections, Improvements, Extensions

Even though data is stored in an immutable way, the metldata still allows for
corrections, improvements, and extensions of submitted data. This is achieved my not
just storing the current state of a submission but by persisting a version history.
Thereby, modifications are realized by issuing a new version of the submission without
affecting the content of existing versions.

#### Transparency

The version history not only resolved the conflict between immutability and the need to
evolve and adapt data, it also make the changes transparent to user relying on the data.

#### Multiple Representations

Often, the requirements regarding the structure and content of data differs depending
the use case and the audience. Metldata accounts for this by proving a configurable
workflow engine for transforming submitted metadata into multiple representation of that
data.

#### GDPR Compliance

The GDPR gives data subjects the right to issue a request to delete data. Metldata
complies with this demand. Thereby, only entire versions of a submission can be deleted.
The associated accessions stay available so that user are informed that the associated
data is not available anymore. The guarantees for immutability and stability of
accessions are not violated, however, data might become unavailable.
